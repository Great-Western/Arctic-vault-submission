# Arctic-vault-submission
My arctic vault submission from 2020 to 3020!
Welcome from 2020!
Sorry if we screwed up Earth, it hasn't happened yet. Also, sorry for the lack of comments in my code - if english is still a thing, I guess those might have been helpful...
If time travel is possible, please bring back cake and don't spoil the next Doctor Who episodes.

One last note:
The answer is 42. Remember that. That's all I can say.
